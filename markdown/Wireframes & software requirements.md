## Description: 
PeerPair is website that enables users to find their a partner, wether it was for a project they are working on or need a study partner, or even a gaming partner.

## What problem does it solve?
A lot of things need a partner to be done, or might be better if you have a partner, but it is not easy to always find that partner in your actual community. Our website gives you the opportunity to find a partner with the same interest or need. For example, if you have an exam for a certain subject and another person also has an exam for that subject, you both can join and study with each other. Or if a group of gamers are missing a player they can find someone who is interested in that game.
